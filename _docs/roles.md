| Software Developer              | 2 - 4             | A lot of the work for this project will be developing software. At least some of the software will be Spring MVC. To complete your project most of the students should contribute to developing software features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Automated Test writer           | 1 - 2             | Each feature must have working unit tests. For more marks, you may add integration tests as taught in CO2006. The software developers for a feature may write these alongside the code, or you may ask different people to work specifically on the automated tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Manual Tester                   | 2 - 3             | Do **not** underestimate the amount of effort that each group must put into testing the software. Each story must have a written log of the tests and bugs that are found are added to Pivotal. If a supervisor or client finds a bug in a feature that the group said was complete this will impact your grade. For every developer you should have a tester (although someone can be both for different features). People should not test features they developed.                                                             |
| Build Engineer                  | >0                | Depending on how complex your continuous integration (Travis) process becomes you may appoint someone to learn more about Gradle and Travis. This person may improve the build process and chase up people that break the build.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Coding standards engineer/fixer | >0                | If you choose to have coding standards as part of your definition of done, you may choose to ask someone to fix coding standards issues that arise. It is probably better that each developer does this for their own code though. You may wish to have someone learn more about how Checkstyle works and how to configure it to refine your process.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Scrum Master                    | >0                | Each group should have a scrum master, that carries out [what is expected from that role](https://www.yodiz.com/blog/scrum-master-job-descriptions-and-responsibilities-in-agile-methodology/). For CO2015 projects the key duties are: 🌟 Ensure you understand the scrum process and ensure that everyone is following (especially in how you complete stories and record this in Pivotal Tracker). 🌟 Notice when people are struggling and help them. 🌟 Arrange the meetings. 🌟 Facilitate the group-estimation of stories |
| Product Owner                   | >0                | Each group should have a product owner. For this project the main responsibilities of the product owner are: 🌟 Lead the discussions with the client. 🌟 Get answers to questions about what features should do or the priority of features. 🌟 Check that the definition of done is completed for each story before hitting the “Deliver” button, prior to the client demo.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Assessment Lead                 | 1 - 2             | The single biggest cause of lost grades in CO2015 is groups not reading the assessments or instructors from the tutors. Each group should have 1 or 2 people whose job it is to ensure they read and re-read the worksheet, and all emails from the convenor/supervisors. They can then check that everyone understands what the group should be doing.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Technology Lead                 | 0 - 2             | The success of a software team depends more on how well everyone performs than how well the “best” person performs. It makes sense for students who are more confident in software development to spend a significant amount of their time supporting others rather than focusing on their own work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Configuration Manager           | >0                | Again the quality of your use of Git will be graded. It may make sense for someone in each group to keep an eye on how others are using Git and if there are problems, discuss them with that person. Groups often don’t earn their maximum possible grade because 1 or 2 people are not using Git as well as the rest of the group.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
